## To Do

### EDA

- [x] Variable Summary
- [ ] Check Null, Missing Data 
- [ ] Distribution Analysis (Red, White, Both) & Class Options (10 classes, 2 classes, 3 classes)
- [ ] Attribute Distribution By Class
- [ ] Box Plot
- [ ] Correlation Map
- [ ] PCA

### Preprocessing

- [ ] Class Attribute
- [ ] Normalization / Standardization
- [ ] Feature Selection (if needed)

### Classification

- [x] Naive Bayes
- [ ] Other Model (to be decided) 
- [x] Train, Test

### Model Evaluation

- [x] Confusion Matrix
- [ ] F1, Accuracy, Recall, ...
- [ ] Model Comparison
- [ ] Computational Time
