## To Do

- [x] Use **training set** in EDA
- [x] Fix Multivariate Analysis
  - [ ] Correlation Plots
  - [ ] PCA Plots
  - [x] Comparison after Outlier Treatment
- [ ] Fix model comparison plots   
- [ ] Statistical Tests for model comparison

## Refinement 

- [x] Separate preliminary analysis from EDA
- [ ] Rename variables (designation clash, ect..)  
- [ ] Documentation
