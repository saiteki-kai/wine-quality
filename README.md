# White Wine Quality

Machine learning course project about wine quality

## Dataset

The dataset used is available from the UCI machine learning
repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

## To Do

- [ ] Use **training set** in EDA
- [ ] Barplot for each variable by quality
- [ ] Fix Multivariate Analysis
  - [ ] PCA Plots
  - [ ] Comparison after Outlier Treatment
- [ ] Fix model comparison plots   
- [ ] Statistical Tests for model comparison

## Refinement 

- [ ] Separate preliminary analysis from EDA
- [ ] Rename variables (designation clash, ect..)  
- [ ] Documentation
